          Frankly, I can keep talking about you all day and night, and still be
          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot imagine my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest you can say achievement(hhahahah) of my life. I hope we
          continue being best friends till the last breaths of our lives.

          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss u when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.<br>
          I have to write so much more but for the start this is it for you will keep updating this keep smiling cutiee

          like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you, damoooo darlinggg.This name given to you is so perfectly perfect .
