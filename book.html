          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot imagine my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest you can say achievement(hhahahah) of my life. I hope we
          continue being best friends till the last breaths of our lives.

          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss u when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.<br>
          I have to write so much more but for the start this is it for you will keep updating this keep smiling cutiee

       <P>The Day to be remembered . My bestiee wore a saree today for the first time .I knew it she would look the most beautiful but she doubted it . I went to see her at her college gate . I was legit happy to go there and see her in a best look she has ever got since now. She was wearing a black saree with a very nice necklace in her neck looking too gorgeous . She could not come out because of her stupid college who were not allowing her to come out we were seeing each other from different sides of a gate just like in jails prisoners and his meeting member do .</P>
       <p>
        I also could gift her the feb gift and even the bouquet from the last month in which her luck is not really good but today was the day i was waiting for so long and eating her head about wearing a saree so ye it is <strong>09-02-2024</strong> and def. it was worth the wait moment for me will always rem about this till last . Obviously wanted to hug u but couldn't So assuming that i will get one really soon Atleast. <br>

      <h3>Phases of friendship...!</h3>
      The best friendship doesn't mean only good things happening in between the two . It also involves very different kind of phases it is in which i m currently going on it was going on very perfectly . then some things happend in her life.I dont have any problem in it but one should know that getting some unexpected things in life doesn't mean you just start focusing on that . you have to balance between everything. I am hear with u for u wherever u want and even if u dont want then there should be a some point of ur responsibilit to provide it the equal importance, time and everything . U r the best in everything just see from my pov what i would be facing , what i would be feeling. Def not telling u to not getting involving in new stuff ... never and i m noone to tell u that even ... bt ...<br>
      <br>
      As u know i take our friendship even more seriously i will def expect u to give some attention , some love , some importance and it does not take much of it.Easies solution is just talk to me when u r talking to me no pne else should be there . In the other times i will not insist u to talk to me ... It feels somewhat like disrespectful when u do talk to multiple ppl while talking to me and i am just seeking and waiting for a reply. Or the other way is we both chat willingly when we both are free accoring to our convinience (which will be the scenerio after 3 4 yrs when we all willl be working ) so if u want to follow that tell me so i just dont push u or force you to do so... choice is yours how u want it however u r comfortable .    
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 17)">
        I just dont want myself to get it all thinking and thinking about this bond i think after these many years I also want and expect something from u and it has to be like that then only it will last long so yah this is it ...! from my side i dont think i m going through a better phase in our friendship so thaught of writing.After all this is all my perspective ur perspective would be Obviously diff it was constantly comming in my head so thought to tell u in this way. Def not leaving u even if u want so yeah good bye!!! Stay happy !
