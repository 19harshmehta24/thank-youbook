          Frankly, I can keep talking about you all day and night, and still be
          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot imagine my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest you can say achievement(hhahahah) of my life. I hope we
          continue being best friends till the last breaths of our lives.

          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss u when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.<br>
          I have to write so much more but for the start this is it for you will keep updating this keep smiling cutiee

       <P>The Day to be remembered . My bestiee wore a saree today for the first time .I knew it she would look the most beautiful but she doubted it . I went to see her at her college gate . I was legit happy to go there and see her in a best look she has ever got since now. She was wearing a black saree with a very nice necklace in her neck looking too gorgeous . She could not come out because of her stupid college who were not allowing her to come out we were seeing each other from different sides of a gate just like in jails prisoners and his meeting member do .</P>
       <p>
        I also could gift her the feb gift and even the bouquet from the last month in which her luck is not really good but today was the day i was waiting for so long and eating her head about wearing a saree so ye it is <strong>09-02-2024</strong> and def. it was worth the wait moment for me will always rem about this till last . Obviously wanted to hug u but couldn't So assuming that i will get one really soon Atleast. <br>
